- [ ] Is everything reasonably sized on the page?
- [ ] When running new queries, is it clear that the app is working, or does it just look frozen?

  - [ ] Fuzzy Search bar at top

  - [ ] Description Search
- [ ] Are the Comcode Legend entries (above the visualisations) showing /only/ the comcodes in play?
